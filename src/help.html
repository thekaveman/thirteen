        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <p>The goal of Thirteen is to be the first player to get rid of all of your cards.</p>

        <h2>Card Ranking</h2>
        <p>Cards are ranked by value, then by suit.</p>
        <p>The lowest card is the <span class="card black">3‚ô†</span> and the highest is the <span class="card red">2‚ô•</span></p>

        <p>The values are ranked from lowest to highest:</p>
        <div class="combination">
          <div id="ranks-container"></div>
        </div>

        <p>The suits are ranked from lowest to highest:</p>
        <div class="combination">
          <div id="suits-container"></div>
        </div>

        <p>For example, the following hand is in order from lowest to highest:</p>
        <div class="combination">
          <div id="hand-container"></div>
        </div>

        <h2>Starting the Game</h2>
        <p>
          The player with the <span class="card black">3‚ô†</span> starts the first round. If no one has the
          <span class="card black">3‚ô†</span>
          the player with the next lowest card starts the first round. The starting player must play the starting card as part of
          any valid combination.
        </p>

        <h2>Playing a Round</h2>
        <p>
          Players take turns playing cards in combinations. The first player of a round can play any valid combination. Subsequent
          players in the same round must play a higher-ranking combination of the same type.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a player cannot or chooses not to play, they must pass. Once a player passes, they cannot play again in that round. A
          round ends when all players have passed after a play. The player who played the last combination wins the round and
          starts the next one.
        </p>

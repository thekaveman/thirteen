# The Future Wishlist

_These are ideas for after the MVP is fully functional and polished._

- [ ] **Polish UI:** Improve the CSS to make the game cleaner and more intuitive
- [ ] **Expand Players:** Update logic to support 2-4 players (a mix of human and AI)
- [ ] **Consecutive Games:** Update logic to support consecutive games with a scoring system (e.g. like gin rummy where you "count up" a score, or like golf where the goal is to finish some number of games with the fewest rounds, or similar)
- [ ] **House Rules:** Support optional rules like _unsuited_ or _suited_ `Straights`
- [ ] **Advanced AI:** Improve the AI to make more strategic decisions instead of just playing the lowest card
- [ ] **Graphics:** Replace the text-based cards with actual card images (SVG) or CSS-styled cards
- [ ] **Multiplayer:** A major undertaking: involves setting up a server (Node.js) and using WebSockets (Socket.IO) for real-time communication
